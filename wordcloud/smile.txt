Smile though your heart is achingSmile even though it's breakingWhen there are clouds in the sky you'll get byIf you smile through your fear and sorrowSmile and maybe tomorrowYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you just...Light up your face with gladnessHide every trace of sadnessAlthough a tear may be ever so nearThat's the time you must keep on tryingSmile, what's the use of cryingYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you just smileThough your heart is achingSmile even though it's breakingWhen there are clouds in the sky you'll get byIf you smile through your fear and sorrowSmile and maybe tomorrowYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you just smileThat's the time you must keep on tryingSmile, what's the use of cryingYou'll find that life is still worthwhileIf you just smileLa da da la da da...
