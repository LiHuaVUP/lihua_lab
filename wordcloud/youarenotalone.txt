Another day has goneI'm still all aloneHow could this be?You're not here with meYou never said goodbyeSomeone tell me whyDid you have to go?And leave my world so coldEveryday I sit and ask myselfHow did love slip away?Something whispers in my ear and saysThat you are not aloneI am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayBut you are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartBut you are not alone'Lone, 'loneWhy, 'loneJust the other nightI thought I heard you cryAsking me to comeAnd hold you in my armsI can hear your prayersYour burdens I will bearBut first I need your handThen forever can beginEveryday I sit and ask myselfHow did love slip away?Something whispers in my ear and saysThat you are not aloneI am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayBut you are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartBut you are not aloneWhisper three words and I'll come runningAnd girl you know that I'll be thereI'll be thereThat you are not aloneI am here with youThough you're far awayI am here to stayBut you are not aloneI am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartFor you are not alone (You are not alone)For I am here with you (I am here with you)Though you're far away (Though you're far away)I am here to stay (You and me)For you are not alone (You're always in my heart)For I am here with youThough we're far apartYou're always in my heartFor you are not aloneNot alone, ohYou are not aloneYou are not aloneSay it againYou are not aloneYou are not aloneNot alone, not aloneIf you just reach out for me girlIn the morning, in the eveningNot alone, not aloneYou and meNot aloneOh, together, togetherGotta stop being aloneGotta stop being alone
