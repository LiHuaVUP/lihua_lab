I was wandering in the rainMask of life, feelin' insaneSwift and sudden fall from graceSunny days seem far awayKremlin's shadow belittlin' meStalin's tomb won't let me beOn and on and on it cameWish the rain would just let me beHow does it feel? (How does it feel?)How does it feel?How does it feel?When you're aloneAnd you're cold insideHere abandoned in my fameArmageddon of the brainKGB was doggin' meTake my name and just let me beThen a begger boy called my nameHappy days will drown the painOn and on and on it cameAnd again, and again, and again...Take my name and just let me beHow does it feel? (How does it feel?)How does it feel?How does it feel?How does it feel?How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)How does it feel?How does it feel?When you're aloneAnd you're cold insideHow does it feel? (How does it feel?)How does it feel?How does it feel?How does it feel?How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)How does it feel?How does it feel?When you're aloneAnd you're cold insideLike a stranger in MoscowLord have mercyLike a stranger in MoscowLord have mercyWe're talkin' dangerWe're talkin' danger babyLike a stranger in MoscowWe're talkin' dangerWe're talkin' danger babyLike a stranger in MoscowI'm livin' lonelyI'm livin' lonely babyA stranger in Moscow
