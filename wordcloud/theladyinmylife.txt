There'll be no darkness tonightLady our love will shineLighting the nightJust put your trust in my heartAnd meet me in paradiseNow is the time girlYou're every wonder in this world to meA treasure time won't steal awaySo listen to my heartLay your body close to mineLet me fill you with my dreamsI can make you feel alrightAnd baby through the yearsGonna love you more each daySo I promise you tonightThat you'll always be the lady in my lifeLay back in my tendernessLet's make this a night we won't forgetGirl, I need your sweet caressReach out to a fantasyTwo hearts in the beat of ecstasyCome to me, girlAnd I will keep you warmThrough the shadows of the nightLet me touch you with my loveI can make you feel so rightAnd baby through the yearsEven when we're old and grayI will love you more each day'Cause you will always be the lady in my lifeStay with meI want you to stay with me
