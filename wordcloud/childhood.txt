Have you seen my Childhood?I'm searching for the world that I come from'Cause I've been looking aroundIn the lost and found of my heart...No one understands meThey view it as such strange eccentricities...'Cause I keep kidding aroundLike a child, but pardon me...People say I'm not okay'Cause I love such elementary things...It's been my fate to compensate,For the ChildhoodI've never known...Have you seen my Childhood?I'm searching for that wonder in my youthLike pirates in adventurous dreams,Of conquest and kings on the throne...Before you judge me, try hard to love me,Look within your heart then ask,Have you seen my Childhood?People say I'm strange that way'Cause I love such elementary things,It's been my fate to compensate,For the Childhood I've never known...Have you seen my Childhood?I'm searching for that wonder in my youthLike fantastical stories to shareThe dreams I would dare, watch me fly...Before you judge me, try hard to love me.The painful youth I've hadHave you seen my Childhood...
