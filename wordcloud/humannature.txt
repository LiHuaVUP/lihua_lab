Looking outAcross the night-timeThe city winks a sleepless eyeHear her voiceShake my windowSweet seducing sighsGet me outInto the night-timeFour walls won't hold me tonightIf this townIs just an appleThen let me take a biteIf they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human natureWhy, why does he do it that way?If they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human natureWhy, why does he do it that way?Reaching outTo touch a strangerElectric eyes are everywhereSee that girlShe knows I'm watchingShe likes the way I stareIf they say, "Why? Why?"Just tell 'em that is human natureWhy, why does he do it that way?If they say, "Why? Why?"(Do you really like me to be around?)Tell 'em that is human natureWhy, why does he do it that way?I like livin' this wayI like lovin' this wayThat way (The way it was.)That way (The way it was.)Looking outAcross the morningThe city's heart begins to beatReaching outI touch her shoulderI'm dreaming of the streetIf they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human natureWhy, why does he do it that way?If they say, "Why? Why?"(Just tell me you like me to be around.)Ooh, tell 'emWhy, why does he do it that way?If they say, "Why? Why?"Why, why does he do it that way?If they say, "Why? Why?"(Just tell me you like me to be around.)Ooh, tell 'emWhy, why does he do it that way?And they say, "Why? Why?"Ooh, tell 'emWhy, why does he do it that way?They say, "Why? Why?"(Just tell me you like me to be around.)Why, why does he do it that way?I like livin' this wayThe wayThe way
